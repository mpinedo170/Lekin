LEKIN (June 1998)
====================

LEKIN is an academic scheduling system.  Its main purpose is to introduce
the students to scheduling theory and applications.  However, the system's
extensibility allows (and encourages) to use it as an algorithm development
tool.

LEKIN supports 6 basic environments: single m/c, parallel m/c, flow shop,
flexible flow shop, job shop, and flexible job shop.

Release version notes
========================

This is a fully functional version, with a complete online manual.  However,
a few minor bugs may have escaped our extensive testing.  Please contact the
developers (see below) if you find any.

System requirements
======================
    - IBM PC compatible
    - Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP
    - 5 MB Hard disk space
    - 8 MB RAM (16 MB recommended)
    - 1 MB video RAM (2 MB recommended)

Comment: LEKIN heavily uses colors -- to identify machines and jobs.  Although
we specifically made sure that the system works well in the 256-color mode, it
is strongly recommended to set up your screen to high-color mode (at least
32768 colors).  If LEKIN discovers that your screen mode is low-color, it bugs
you to "increase the color depth of your screen".

To install
=============

Please read these instructions carefully.  Although the installation process is
straightforward, there are some important points you don't want to miss.  Please
pay special attention to step 3.

In order to install LEKIN in your system, you have to execute the "Lekin.exe"
file.  You can obtain this file from the Web, over e-mail, or on a CD.

     1. Carefully read the terms of the License agreement and press "I agree".
     2. Select an installation directory for LEKIN.  Default is
        "C:\Program Files\Lekin"; you can change it as you wish.  Press "Next"
        when you are done.  If LEKIN has been previously installed in your
        system, you will not be allowed to change the installation directory.
        If you need to change it, you will need to cancel setup, uninstall
        LEKIN through Control Panel, and rerun setup.
     3. If you intend to use LEKIN for developing your own algorithms and sending
        them out, you should identify yourself -- more or less uniquely.  Otherwise,
        when someone tries to import your algorithm into his system, it may wipe out
        one of the previously imported algorithms.  You should choose a "call sign"
        for yourself.  The name of your company, accompanied by your own name,
        should do the trick.  Please press "Install" when done.
     4. LEKIN will now install itself onto your system.
     5. Press "Close".  LEKIN was successfully installed!
