Text=If you intend to use LEKIN for developing your own algorithms and sending them out, you should identify yourself -- more or less uniquely.  Otherwise, when someone tries to import your algorithm into his system, it may wipe out one of the previously imported algorithms.  You should choose a "call sign" for yourself.  The name of your company, accompanied by your own name, should do the trick.
