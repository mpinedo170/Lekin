In order to build the system, you need:

MS Visual Studio .NET 2017.
Nullsoft NSIS (freeware, can be downloaded from sourceforge).

Projects:

AFLib -- DLL with common functions.
Asm -- main LEKIN module.
Gen -- problem generator (written in a hurry, just for testing purposes).
Helper -- is used to build the help file.
LSearch -- Local Search program by Stephan Kreipl.
NSIBuilder -- scans the data directories, builds Data.nsh for building the installer.
Sample -- sample algorithm that can be "linked" to LEKIN.
SB -- Shifting Bottleneck program.
SBLS -- Shifting Bottleneck / Local Search program by Ya Yang.
SBTWT -- Shifting Bottleneck for Total Weighted Tardiness program by Marcos Singer.
Summer -- computes the control sum of the program executable.
TestAlg -- I used it to test output redirection for plug-in algorithms.

Building the system.

1. Copy everything from the CD to a chosen folder on the hard drive.
2. Clear read-only attributes on all files. E.g., "attrib -R path /S /D".
3. Open .\Asm.sln in MS Visual Studio .NET 2017.
4. Build the Release version of the entire solution.
5. Run NSIBuilder (either from the Explorer or from Visual Studio .NET).
6. Open MakeNSISW (Compiler GUI).
7. To compile .\Install\Lekin.nsi, drag it from the explorer into the MakeNSISW window.
8. Done!  .\Media\Lekin.exe is the installer.

Sample problem files can be found in Misc\Data and Misc\Data2.  They are also included
in the installation package.
